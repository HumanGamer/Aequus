To-Do:
* Granite and Marble biomes can no longer spawn in the Jungle

* Added a surface tunnel which leads into the Crab Crevice
* Added two new Cave variants: Weird, and Tall

* The Underground Forest can no longer generate on top of Marble, Granite, Sand, Ice, or Mushroom tiles
* Slight buffs to Fertile/Chlorophyte Powder to make it more usable
