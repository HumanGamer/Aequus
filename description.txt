Aequus Mod is an unfinished mod made for fun. It doesn't have any serious intentions and was only created for me to mess around :)
> Important <
# A discord link for the mod is in the Homepage! #
# This mod is opened sourced and assets are extractable #
# Currently, this mod is NOT multiplayer friendly. You can still try multiplayer, but don't expect it to be stable! #
# The wiki is currently a disaster so any help with that is appreciated! #

Currently Contains:
178 Items
13 Enemies
1 Town NPC
1 Critter
2 Bosses
3 Events
0 Mounts
10 Tiles
1 Wall
Many bugs (ahahah)
