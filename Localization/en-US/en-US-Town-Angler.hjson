				Description: The carpenter was in a lot of panic when one of the bricks on their beachside house jumped away, making the entire building fall! Turns out, the brick grew fins and was desperate for water! I don't know where he gets his materials, but that one is clearly possessed. Reel it in and bring it to me, I always wanted to smash someone over the head with a fish!
				CatchLocation: Caught near villager buildings
