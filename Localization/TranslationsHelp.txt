A couple simple things you might want to know if you are doing a translation for Aequus (Or most mods really)

Requirements: Knowing english so you can read and translate the in game text

Other Important Info:

en-US = English
de-DE = German
zh-Hans = Chinese (Simplified)
es-ES = Spanish
pt-BR = Portugese
# All of the languages below do not have a single translation
it-IT = Italian
fr-FR = French
ru-RU = Russian
pl-PL = Polish

Try to do translations for major updates, because it's a bit annoying to do translations for every minor update which might add a couple extra language values here and there

############################################################

The first thing you will notice is that there are weird pieces of text with an = sign
The first two words on every line is the key (They can techincally be longer but I don't think I have gone past 2 words per key)


NPCName.Omegastarite=

NPCName.OmegaStarite is the key, it is quite easy to see that this means the name of the NPC interally called "OmegaStarite"
the text after the = is the actual language value

NPCName.OmegaStarite=Omega Starite
(It is important to not add a space before or after the equals sign. Even though it would be easy to fix if you do that, it's just a waste of time for me and you)
Omega Starite is the text you will see in game, so lets change that.

NPCName.OmegaStarite=Dumb Blue Spheres Boss
Dumb Blue Spheres Boss will now become Omega Starite's name. Congratulations.

Another thing you should watch for is curly braces with a $ {$}, these are normally language commands which tell the game 
to fetch a language value from somewhere else and put it there. 
{$Mods.AQMod.NPCName.OmegaStarite} would fetch the name of Omega Starite in the proper language

{0} or {1} or {2}, ect... are values which get replaced. So if I write
{0} is the number of enemies on screen

and set it to the number of enemies on screen (example: 20 enemies)
20 is the number of enemies on screen

or

{0} went too high in space

and set it to the name of a player {example name: Dylan}
Dylan went too high in space

{0} allows me to dynamically change the text. So you shouldn't replace those if you are doing a translation.

(TL;DR The only things that {0} should mean is a number, or a name of something)

############################################################

There are many puns and plays on words, there are also many English phrases which might not translate well into other languages.

So for something like "Magmalbulbia" You should probably split it into "Magma" and "Bulb"
and then find a clever combination of the two which would work in the language

Other words like "Bossrushium" don't really work well in other languages, so you can change them up in order to fit better
so something like "Test of Endurance" or whatever would be a good alternative

(TL;DR don't be afraid to change things if they don't work in a language)

That should hopefully be enough info for anyone who wants to do a translation, cya!
