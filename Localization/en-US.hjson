				2: Dogs are unfortunately afraid of heights, and will jump off your hot air balloon if you try to go hunting with them. Do not ask if I have experience with this.

				8: Testing... testing... Everything seems to be in order.
				9: Get away from there, {0}! I'm expecting an important message from {1}!

				BloodMoon: {
					0: This total lunar eclipse is very chaotic, nothing like on my original planet.

					0: Hmm, interesting, I didn't know that stars are somehow able to create intelligence from pure chaos...

					2: Before nightfall, I saw a falling star which looked like it was going towards the ground... now that this event is happening, I'm pretty sure that it's one of those powerful sources.
					3: Sometimes I look into the sky and see another solar system... but it must be a mirage from the amount of light reflecting off the surface of the planet, even if I cannot prove that it is a mirage.
