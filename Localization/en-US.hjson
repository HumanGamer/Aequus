				HateBiome: Are you trying to make me go through living hell? What is wrong with your species?
				LoveNPC: I greatly adore {NPCName}, their parts are so highly functional!
				LikeNPC: "{NPCName} is quite nice. Although they aren't the best in science experiments, too busy with their less important stuff I guess."
				DislikeNPC: I do not have the greatest opinion on {NPCName}. Atleast they aren't decorated in a dumb outfit.
				HateNPC: Ew, {NPCName}? I can't stand them, they have to stop pretending to be all 'whimsical and magical'.

				Content: This place is good enough, could definitely get better internet service in the Underworld Domain though.
				NoHome: Hey? Are you trying to make me go back to living in the Gore Nest?
				FarFromHome: Oh, you caught me snooping around the place, I'll be home by midnight, I promise.
				LoveSpace: Oh yes! This place is quite great, my own room... plus some people to practice magic on!
				DislikeCrowded: Erm- There's quite a lot of people here. That'd be great if my spells could hypnotize more than 2 folks.
				HateCrowded: I can't stand the crowdedness of this place! There's no point in being secretive if your every move can be heard by the entire town.
				LikeBiome: "The {BiomeName} is one of my favorite places to practice rituals! You should join me in one someday."
				LoveBiome: "{BiomeName} is one of my favorite places to practice rituals! You should join me in one someday."
				DislikeBiome: Ah yes, the {BiomeName}, my favorite place to throw my garbage.
				HateBiome: Y'know, it's kind of funny how the Underworld is more enjoyable than {BiomeName}.
				LoveNPC: Hey, tell {NPCName} I finished making them chocolate pancakes!- Hehe- They're one of my favorite people.
				LikeNPC: "{NPCName} has never flinched when I tried fire spells on them. They must have incredible pain tolerance!" 
				DislikeNPC: "{NPCName} is quite annoying, atleast not as bad as some of my friends from Hell."
				HateNPC: I've literally sent {NPCName} to hell and back... too bad that spell wipes there memory after finishing.

				Content: This place is good matey! Could always be better though, yo ho ho!
				NoHome: How will I store my stolen goods without me ship!? Definitely not digging up a lobster crevice that's for sure!
				FarFromHome: "{$Mods.Aequus.TownNPCMood.Exporter.NoHome}"
				LoveSpace: Yarr this place is mighty fine lad, could probably setup shop here and continue my work.
				DislikeCrowded: I would be liking this place, many people to steal from, yet many more eyes to spot you.
				HateCrowded: Once enough people are in a place, it's hard to steal anything anymore! Get some of these maties out'ta here!
				LikeBiome: "{BiomeName} is not too bad matey, better than me ship!"
				LoveBiome: "{BiomeName} is the best place to consider home."
				DislikeBiome: Matey, {BiomeName} makes me shell dry!
				HateBiome: "Argh! {BiomeName} is such a horrible place to be in, I'd rather be on me ship!"
				LoveNPC: "{NPCName} has to be one of my most favorite crewmates- or well, housemates, I haven't gotten them to join me crew yet."
				LikeNPC: Y'know {NPCName}? This landlubber cleaned off a barnacle which was growing on me chest! Their appreciation for animals gave me a lot of respect for them. 
				DislikeNPC: Can't stand {NPCName}! I'm wanting to kick him off me ship- Err, house?
				HateNPC: I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR {NPCName}! This landlubber reported all of my acts of tax evasion!

		Bounty: {
			Common: {
				NotEnoughFurniture: Place some more decoration and furniture in this build! It is feeling very bland and lacking.
			}

			BiomePaletteBounty: {
				"$parentVal": Delicious Palette 
				Description: Build a house which fits in
				Requirements:
					'''
					House must be constructed using blocks and walls which match the biome's color
					Suitable for 1 town NPC
					5+ Furniture
					'''
				Hint: (Hint: Use Biome Hair Dye to discover biome color)

				Reply: {
					NoHouses: I don't see any houses in this image, try taking a better snip of what you want to show me. 
					ImproperlyColoredHouses: Unfortunately this house don't fit the coloring criteria of the bounty, try painting the building or using blocks which fit the biome's color.
					Complete: Oh that structure fits in perfectly with the biome, perfect choice of colors! I should hang this clip up on my wall- oh I'm going too far aren't I...
				}
			}

			PirateShipBounty: {
				"$parentVal": Pirate's Ship
				Description: Build a pirate ship
				Requirements:
					'''
					Walls must be partially submerged underwater
					Suitable for 2 town NPCs
					15+ Furniture
					'''

				Reply: {
					NotEnoughRooms: You forgot to make this build have suitable housing, I don't think a pirate crew would want to sleep on the deck, oh, and it's written on the bounty that it needs rooms.
					NotEnoughWater: The walls are not submerged in water, unfortunately I find it hard to call this a ship.
					NotEnoughFurniture: "{$Mods.Aequus.Bounty.Common.NotEnoughFurniture}"
					Completed: Good job on creating a ship! It should be able to sail out to sea in no-time! Well, probably not, I don't think ships of that type can set sail.
				}

				"$parentVal": Grand Fountain
				Description: Build a nice looking fountain
				Requirements:
					'''
					Must be mirrored horizontally
					Waterfalls must flow down atleast 7 blocks
					Must be made out of craftable blocks (Ex: Gray Brick)
					'''

				Reply: {
					NoWaterfalls: Oh dear I see no waterfalls in this photo, you can't have a fountain without water! Then it's just a fancy statue.
					ShortWaterfalls: The waterfalls shown in this fountain are simply too short, be sure they go down by 7 blocks!
					NoCraftedBlocks: You are getting there but do remember to use crafted blocks! Maybe pile up some stone and turn them into nice bricks?
					NotSymmetric: Your fountain is quite close to being great! But make sure the tiles completely symmetric!
					Completed: That fountain is quite spectactular! You have great potential as a builder, I can see it in you.
