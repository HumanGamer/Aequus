				LoveSpace: It's now scientific rule that this space is quite amazing.
				DislikeCrowded: The increased amount of living specimens in this town is starting to become too much.
				HateCrowded: I have heard about your species... you like cramping others into tight spaces and give them the bare minimum to survive yet still produce what you want. I don't like how you are seemingly proving this correct.
