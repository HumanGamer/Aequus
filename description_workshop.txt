[b]Overview[/b]
Aequus is a project full of experimental features and content, woven together into a singular experience. We make this mod for fun, and take a lot of inspiration from other games, mods, shows, and other stuff.
Most of the content is before Plantera, don't expect to see much after that point.

[b]Important![/b]
Please report bugs to the steam workshop page or discord server! Your reports help make this project more stable.
